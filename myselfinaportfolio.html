            <p>Hey there! Myself Ashneet Kaur. Welcome here! I don't know how you landed here but I will be glad if you went with me on this journey at my land and I'm sure you are gonna love it! And.. so about me, huh? Well, I am just an ordinary girl who you would meet or even just see while passing by some path. Maybe we have crossed paths, maybe we haven't. What does that matter anyway, right? Uhm I don't really know what exactly I should write here.. But I'm just gonna try my best to open up every relevant thing and even some irrelevant ones for fun. 
                <br>
                <img src="https://www.bing.com/th/id/OGC.c7773f2062ab779347e0b214f4bc52de?pid=1.7&rurl=http%3a%2f%2fgifimage.net%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2017%2f09%2fblack-aesthetic-gif-14.gif&ehk=mMzu2bTKnW4oqG3VlzlZZVX%2fhLme2a%2brjRAkNuTSxfI%3d">
                I am the native of the biggest city of Punjab, Ludhiana, which is also known as Manchester of India. I have a younger brother and we have a seven year age difference. My father is in cloth manufacturing business and my mother is a teacher in a government primary school. Although I was born in a middle class family, I have lead a life of a princess. I have never been denied of anything. I am blessed to have been born like this.
        <br> As for my personality, my MBTI is ESTP-E. I can be a good entrepreneur according to it. And it may be clear from now that I'm like a radio and I can talk to anyone about anything. I sometimes trust easily while at others, I don't. I respect the ones who deserve respect. As for others, I myself don't know. I dream of travelling the world and have high aspirations. I don't watch motivational videos as in my opinion, they are more like demotivating. I feel that instead of wasting time watching them, why not utilize the time for actually doing something and achieving a target? 
        <br> Now, time to tell a secret: I am actually an alien from Jupiter. I landed here accidentally and wanted to go away but unfortunately, my spaceship was destroyed and it will still take years to repair it. The work is on. I will be back soon, my alien friends. And my dears who are taking time to read this, beware of me as the spaceship can be repaired at any moment and those who are gonna dislike me after reading this, mind you, I'm gonna take you on a journey of the universe with me!

            <h1 class="me">EDUCATION AND <br> EXPERIENCES</h1>
            <p> Well, I am currently studying in the second semester of Bachelor Of Commerce. In 12th, I scored 96.2% in CBSE Commerce and in 10th standard CBSE, my score was 94.8%. 12th score got me 2nd rank in school and 10th score got me 5th rank. I was really happy with both! I have always been a straight-A student but I didn't expect such good grades. So, ofcourse it made me happy.

                <br>
                As for my experience, I have been an HR Associate at Homeflic Wegrow Pvt Ltd for 3 months (February, 2021 to April, 2021). I quit because of personal reasons but I wanna go for another internship or part-time job again. Working at Homeflic Wegrow taught me so much and helped in my overall development. It made me boost my confidence. Talking to so many people on a daily basis and that also in different parts of the country made me open up a lot. I slowly even started shifting from being an ambivert to an extrovert. Talking on phone used to be so difficult for me but now I can easily do it with anyone. Moreover, doing sales during the start of my internship with them also gave a boost to my pursuasion power. And getting trained to be a Team Leader will only help me in so many ways in future. Though I was just a point of contact (POC) between the Team Leader and the new interns, it also helped me to interact easily with others, keep them motivated and help them in every way possible. It also made me realise that even I can do team leading when I never believed I could ever do (though I didn't go for the position of team leading because it was not according to my interest).

            <h1 class="me">HOBBIES AND<br> INTERESTS</h1>
            <p>I love reading novels, writing fictions and fanfictions, scrolling through and writing answers on Quora, gaining knowledge on things that interest me through the internet,
                working out, dancing on kpop, singing randomly, learning new languages, learning about other cultures, watching videos on graphic designing and trying out designs, reading webtoons and so much more.
                <br>
                Also, my interests lie in so many things. I'm interested in East-Asian community, their culture and of course their entertainment industry. I love listening to kpop and jpop, even cpop sometimes. And I've watched 
                their dramas too. Moroever, I also love designing things. I'm interested in designing interiors, graphics and anything in general. As I read in a novel, there is beauty only in making something, not destroying it. 
                <br>

                Now, time for some fun knowledge about my interests:
                <br>
 -My favorite novelists are JK Rowling, Charles Dickens and Jeff Kinney. I have not read all of the books in the Harry Potter series but I will try to complete it soon. I have read Great Expectations, Oliver Twist, A Tale of Two Cities and I think some more novels of Charles Dickens and I'm currently reading David Copperfield. Jeff Kinney's Diary of a Wimpy Kid series is a masterpiece in my opinion and should get even more popularity and love. I have also read the Nancy Drew series but now I don't read it anymore. Also, there are some other novels which I love like Little Women, Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre.
  <br>
  -I have written fanfictions in the past as well though they are still not complete. One that I have continuesd recently is based on th Harry Potter series. As for fictions, well, I have thought about some ideas which I would like to pen down soon!              
  <br>
-I have got nearly 65 followers on Quora and people like to read my answers there. So it makes me think that I am good at writing them hehe.
<br>
-I like working out but I don't love it. I mean I will be okay without it but I do it to stay in shape. But whenevr I do, I really enjoy it.
<br>
-In Kpop, I stan many groups but mostly I listen to OSTs of Kdramas. The groups I stan include BTS, TXT, Mamamoo, Apink, The Boyz and many more.

            <h1 class="me">ACHIEVEMENTS</h1>
            <p>As told earlier, I have always been a Straight-A student all through my school life. I have achieved awards for that almost every year since Upper Kindergarten. I participate in quizzes and competitions too. I have also won a lot of awards in Kanth Bani Competition held every year in our school. 
                <br>
                <img src="https://www.bing.com/th/id/OGC.4b9c10f1729d7d661aa29021a0adbac4?pid=1.7&rurl=https%3a%2f%2fi.pinimg.com%2foriginals%2f9c%2ffb%2ff2%2f9cfbf2a3ef56089624822bedbea2da64.gif&ehk=odcSuk58hjEXmxCSjQBNo6SvZqcHzK4In3QFcRNdTcU%3d">
                I'm also proud to say that on Wattpad, my fanfiction that I mentioned earlier achieved 58.8th rank out of 53.3k fictions and fanfictions in the category of "diary". Many people have given positive reviews to it on Fanfiction.net and I try to follow the critical ones in a constructive way. I have written 60+ short poems in the past too.
                <br> 
               
                While working at Homeflic Wegrow as a POC, I have tried my best to lead two teams of 60+ people (combined) and prepared reports on them to submit to my team leader. 
                <br> 
                I have also participated in many talent competitions during my years in Primary school. 
                <br>
                I was selected to be a Discipline Incharge of my house in 10th grade and I helped prepare my juniors for their competitions.
                <br>
                My name has many times been printed in newspapers. Even these days, my picture has been displayed outside the school as a 12th grade topper.
